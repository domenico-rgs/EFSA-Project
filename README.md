# EFSA-Project
It is requested to propose an appropriate statistical model and to analyse the data of an EFSA case study
about an hypothetical toxicological in-vivo experiment

## To do
* Plot dose-response data for each pair endpoint-gender (6 plots) with error bars reflecting error size on response measurements.
* Use subset selection to estimate separate models for the 3 endpoints using gender as categorical variable.
* Use subset selection to estimate a unique model using gender and endpoint as categorical variables.
* In points 2. and 3., heteroscedasticity of the data should be taken into account.
